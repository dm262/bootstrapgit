            <p class="lead text-dark">  Our coffees fall along a range of tastes and flavors from light and bright to bold
                and intense.We only purchase from the best artisans. All our coffee beans are gotten through
                direct
                sourcing and through the dedicated team of cupping experts

            <p class="lead text-dark">      Our story begins in 1995 - a story not so different from many other entrepreneurs and
                dreamers. At the time,
                finding great tasting, fresh roasted coffee was surprisingly elusive. So, Doug Zell and Emily Mange decided to
                do something about it. They didn’t set out to change the world, just a small corner of it.
                Relocating from San Francisco, they opened their own coffee bar and retail store in Chicago’s eclectic Lakeview
                neighborhood. Roasting their coffee in-store, with equipment that was more antique than state-of-the-art, they
                honed their craft, seeking nothing less than perfection in every aspect of the experience. Little did Doug and
                Emily know that what started as a way to connect with people and the community in an intimate, personal way
                would blossom into something that would help shape an entire industry
